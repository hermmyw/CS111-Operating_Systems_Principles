File included:
(1) lab3b.py
	Source file that analyzes a file system summary (*.csv) and report all inconsistencies:
	Block:
		invalid: <0 or > totalblocks
		reserved: valid and <first_data_block
					first_data_block = first_inode+inodsize*inode#/blksize
		unreferenced: valid and unreserved free=0 and alloc=0
		allocated: valid and unreserved and free=1 and alloc=1
		duplicate: valid and unreserved and used or duplicate

	Inode:
		allocated: nonzero linkcount and nonzero mode
		freed: on freelist
		alloc: alloc=1 and free=1
		unalloc: alloc=1 and free=0

	Directory:
		linkcount: allocated and linkcount[totalinodes]=refcount[totalinodes], initialized to 0
		check allocation status and validity of each referneced inode
			invalid: <1 or >totalinode
			unallocated: alloc=0 and free=1
		..: parent, the inode that has a reference to it
		.: itself
	Exit 2 when inconsistencies are found

(2) Makefile
	Compile source code and perform tests

(3) mycsv.csv
	Testing file

(4) Readme



Test case:
(1) .. points to itself
(2) reserved block on freelist
(3) reserved inode on freelist
(4) referenced a block multiple times by a single file
(5) circular directory



Limitation:
(1) Only work for a single block group
(2) Assume SUPERBLOCK and GROUP are read first
(3) does not check when . or .. doesn't exist
(4) Ignore negative inode number or inode > total inode in inode allocation audit
(5) All reserved are treated as allocated
