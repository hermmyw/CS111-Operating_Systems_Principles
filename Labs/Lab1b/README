FILES:
(1) simpsh.c
	Built upon Lab 1A, simpsh.c implements the following options:
	[--rdwr f]: open a file for reading and writing.

	[--pipe]: create a pipe using pipe(2). Each pipe has a write end and a read
	 end and opens two file descriptors.

	[--wait]: wait for all processes to terminate. Exit with the highest exit 
	code. Print the exit status of each child process along with its 
	arguments. Wait only for the commands that appear before it. 

	[--close N]: close the Nth file. Invalidate the file descriptor. Set the 
	error when the following commands want to open a closed file or pipe. 

	[--abort]: immediately dump core.

	[--catch N]: catch signal N that follows it.

	[--ignore N]: ignore signal N that follows it.

	[--default N]: restore the default behavior of signal N.

	[--pause]: wait for a signal.

	...and the following flags used to achieve advanced functions of opening 
	files:
	[--append]: when writing, the offset is at the end of the file. 
	[--cloexec]: close the file on execution. It is important in multithreaded 
	programs to avoid race conditions.
	[--creat]: create the file if it does not exist.
	[--directory]: fail if pathname is not a directory.
	[--dsync]: provide data integrity to write operations. Transfer data and 
	metadata that would be required to retrieve that data to the hardware. 
	[--excl]: fail open() if the file has already existed.
	[--nofollow]: fail open() if the file is a symbolic link.
	[--nonblock]: any operations on the file will not cause the caller to 
	wait. This flag has no effect for regular files or block devices.
	[--rsync]: 
	[--sync]: provide file integrity on write operations. Transfer the output 
	data and associated file metadata to the hardware.
	[--trunc]: Truncate to 0 if the file already exists and has write permission.

(2) Makefile
	Makefile provides test cases for options
	- rdwr
	- pipe
	- close
	- wait
	- catch
	- default
	- abort


BUGS:
(1) '--abort' is implemented by dereferencing a null pointer instead of 
raise(SIGSEGV). I found that using raise() would cause '--verbose' to 
behave incorrectly. The standard output could not be redirected to the 
designated file.

(2) O_RSYNC and O_SYNC have the same value. I only implemented '--sync' in 
order to successfully compile. "Linux implements O_SYNC and O_DSYNC, but not 
O_RSYNC.  (Somewhat incorrectly, glibc defines O_RSYNC to have the same value 
as O_SYNC.)"
