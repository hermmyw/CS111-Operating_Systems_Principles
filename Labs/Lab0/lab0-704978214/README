Smoke-test cases:
(1) Check if the output file copies the input file exactly...
	(a) in different forms of stdin and stdout
	(b) using different contents of the input file
	(c) using multiple inputs and outputs
	(d) using the same file as the input and the output
(2) Check syntax error when...
	(a) a required option argument is not specified
	(b) providing a nonoption
	(c) a syntax error coexists with another error
(3) Check input error using...
	(a) a nonexistent file
	(b) a nonexistent file and a valid file
	(c) an unreadable file
(4) Check output error using...
	(a) an unwrittable file
(5) Check segmentation fault, catch, and dump-core by arranging these arguments
 in different orders


Limitation:
(1) The program does not distinguish between the full spelling of an option and
 a partial spelling of an option. E.g. '--in' will work just as '--input'.
(2) The program will first check syntax errors. If a syntax error is present 
along with other types of errors, the program will exit from the syntax error.
