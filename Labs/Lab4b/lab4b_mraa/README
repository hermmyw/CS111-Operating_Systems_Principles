Files:
(1) lab4b.c
	Implement a program that reads data from the temperature sensor and log the results. The program also supports reading from either a pipe or standard input on the terminal.

(2) Makefile
	Build the program and perform smoke-test.

(3) Readme

Testing:
1. a START when you are already started is a no-op.
2. a STOP when you are already stopped is a no-op.
3. Program exits with invalid command/argument
4. Invalid arguments

Limitation:
1. Assume that the sensors are connected as recommended by the Grove documentation.
2. LOG in the terminal input will not have an effect unless a log file is specified.
3. If an invalid command is received, it will still be logged to the log file before the program exits.
