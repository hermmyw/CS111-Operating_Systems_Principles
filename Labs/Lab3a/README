Files included:
	(1) lab3a.c
		C source file that produces a summary of the input image file.
		The summary includes a description of super block, groups, free blocks, free inodes, inodes, indirect blocks, and directories. 

	(2) ext2_fs.h
		A header file that defines the data structures in the EXT2 file system. 

	(3) Makefile
		Compile lab3a.c and produce a tarball containing the necessary files.

	(4) README

Log:
	(1) Superblock
		If blocksize == 1024
	        Superblock at block 1
	    else if blocksize > 1024
	        Superblock at block 0 (always at block offset 1024)

	    If pointer == magic number -> check for correctness of reading superblock


	(2) Inode table
    	Traverse inode table, check nonzero link count and block count

	(3) Indirect block references
        if there are more than 12 block pointers:
        offset for the 13th block pointer: bsize*block_id
        1. 13~268
        2. (n-1)*bsize
        3. log_offset++

        offset for the first pointer in double indirect block: 
        1. 269~269+65535
        2. 13+256 ~ 13+256+256*255
        3. log_offset += 256

        offset for the first pointer in the triple indirect block: 
        1. 269+65536 ~ 269+65536+16777216
        2. 13+256+256*256 ~ 13+256+256*256+256*256*255
        3. log_offset += 256*256
        
        ** 256 = bsize/4

Limitations:
	(1) The program only supports a single group of blocks.
	(2) Added `#include <sys/types.h>` to ext2_fs.h to avoid compilation error.
