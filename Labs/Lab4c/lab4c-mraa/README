Files:
(1) lab4c_tcp.c
	Implement a program that reads data from the temperature sensor and log the results. 
	Open a TCP connection and send reports to the server.
	The program also takes input from the server instead of standard input.

(2) lab4c_tls.c
	Implement a program that reads data from the temperature sensor and log the results. 
	Open a TLS connection and send reports to the server.
	The program also takes input from the server instead of standard input.

(2) Makefile
	Build the program and perform smoke-test.

(3) Readme

Testing:
1. Program exits with invalid command/argument
2. Invalid arguments

Limitation:
1. Assume that the sensors are connected as recommended by the Grove documentation.
2. Must have a host and an ID specified before starting to read temperature data.
3. If an invalid command is received, it will still be logged to the log file before the program exits.
