FILES and TESTING:
(1) simpsh.c
	Built upon Lab 1b, simpsh.c adds '--profile' option, which outputs user 
	time and system of every option and of child processes that have been 
	terminated or successfully waited for. 

(2) Makefile
	Makefile consists of several test cases. 'make check' was written based on 
	lab1b's makefile. Every command is added '--profile' to manually check 
	if the output file contains the correct time information. 

(3) report.pdf
	The file presents the comparison among Bash, Dash, and simpsh. There are 
	3 benchmarks provided, and each shell runs each benchmark three times. 
	The result is obtained by averaging the three trials. In the report, I 
	have shown Simpsh is the fastest shell, Dash the second, and Bash the 
	slowest.
